# Retail Sales Analysis & Customer Segmentation

A comprehensive data science project analyzing retail sales data and performing customer segmentation using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes **10,000+ retail transactions** worth **$2.3M in revenue** to uncover business insights and segment customers into actionable groups using K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 9,994 transactions across 4 years
- RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for 793 customers
- K-Means Clustering to segment customers into 4 distinct groups
- Interactive Visualizations using Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- Business Intelligence with actionable recommendations

## Key Findings

### Business Metrics
- Total Revenue: $2,297,200
- Total Profit: $286,397
- Profit Margin: 12.47%
- Total Customers: 793
- Total Orders: 5,009

### Critical Insights
1. Top 20% of customers generate 65%+ of total revenue
2. High discounts (30%+) are unprofitable, losing $107 per order
3. Technology category has the best profit margin (17.4%)
4. Furniture category needs improvement (only 2.49% margin)
5. 4 Customer Segments identified with distinct behaviors

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.12
- Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy - Numerical computing
- Scikit-learn - Machine learning (K-Means clustering)
- Matplotlib - Data visualization
- Seaborn - Statistical data visualization
- Plotly - Interactive visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook - Development environment

## Business Recommendations

1. Optimize Discount Strategy - Cap at 20% (Expected: 8-12% profit increase)
2. Focus on Furniture Category - Improve margins to 8-10%
3. Customer Retention Program - Reduce churn by 15-20%
4. Prioritize High-Value Customers - Add $300K-$400K revenue
5. Seasonal Inventory Planning - Add $150K peak season sales
